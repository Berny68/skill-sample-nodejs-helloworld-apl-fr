# Build your First Skill with APL

This Alexa sample Skill is a template to illustrate basic features of the Alexa Presentation Language ([APL](https://developer.amazon.com/fr/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-overview.html)).

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end. The front end is the voice interface, or VUI. The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model. The back end is where the logic of your skill resides. ([APL](https://developer.amazon.com/fr/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-overview.html)) Templates & datasources for multimodal rendering are part of the backend.

## Skill Setup Options
To follow the Step-by-Step guide, you can get started [here](./instructions/00-setup.md).

If you want to directly setup the final Skill, Developers with the ASK Command Line Interface (CLI) configured may follow the [ASK CLI instructions](./instructions/00-setup-ask-cli.md).
